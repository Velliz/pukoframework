## How to contribute

Puko Framework is originaly known as a simple template engine. 
But in spring 2016 i decide to add a MVC mechanism to it.
After A year of development and 5 project deployed with Puko Framework. 
I make it open source in GitHub to tell everyone the framework i build from scratch 
and to hear from you what the great part, what part are bad, and receive feedbacks
to make it better over time.

So basicly the project is divided into 2 part of projects.

and also Puko Comand Line Interface (PCLI).
